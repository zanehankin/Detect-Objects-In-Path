# Detect-Objects-In-Path
### Using camera to detect a safe route for walking!

> This is the app I built to help anybody who is visually impaired navigate their way. This app detects vertical surfaces and notifies you to turn either left or right depending which route has/does not have a vertical surface in your path. This app is also great for navigating through a maze!

### Process

> We were given an open assignment to build our own app. The two requirements were: <b> 1. Include any of the topics that we have covered so far</b> and <b>2. Incorporate an element of coding that we did not know how to do.</b> I was fascinated by our projects in Augmented Reality (AR), so I knew that I wanted my app to include elements of that. First requirement, <b>check</b>. Then, I needed to figure out what I was going to accomplish with my app. I looked through my class's <i>Topics Page</i> and stumbled upon a Ted Talk that we watched when we first began our unit on AR. In this <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/joseph_redmon_how_a_computer_learns_to_recognize_objects_instantly?language=en">Ted Talk,</a> Joseph Redmon presented about a project he was working on in Graduate school called YOLO. It can detect and correctly identify everyday objects in real-time. I took Redmon's idea and combined it with the everyday task of walking. I figured out that I wanted to be able to walk and have an app direct me based on whether or not there are objects in my path. <b>"How was I going to do this??", I asked myself.</b>

> I started by researching the YOLO project.
